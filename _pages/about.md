<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Chen Wei, a joint Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at the University of Birmingham and Southern University of Science and Technology, expected to graduate in October 2025. My research focuses on **modeling individual mental representations and behavioral intervention**, integrating generative artificial intelligence with active experimental design to uncover and model individual differences in perception, memory, decision-making, aesthetics, and emotion, as well as to explore computational mechanisms for behavioral intervention. More recently, my work has focused on leveraging large language models to analyze deep individual differences in preferences and values, and, through adaptive language-interaction experimental paradigms, to build a **mental world model** that captures individual cognitive traits and behavioral mechanisms. 

I am currently seeking postdoctoral or related research positions. If you are interested in academic collaboration or have relevant opportunities in AI and cognitive sciences, please feel free to contact me at [chen.wei.hdg@gmail.com](mailto:chen.wei.hdg@gmail.com).

üìÑ **[Download my CV (PDF)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/CV_ChenWei.pdf)**

I graduated from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics with a bachelor's degree in Finance, and I am currently pursuing a joint **Ph.D. in Psychology** at **University of Birmingham** and **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, co-advised by Prof. Dietmar Heinke and Prof. Quanying Liu. 
I have published over **15 first-/corresponding-author papers** in top-tier conferences and journals, such as *NeurIPS, ICML, IJCAI, ACMMM, CogSci, The Innovation* and *iScience*, with over **490 citations** and an **H-index of 8**.
I serve as a reviewer for leading venues like *NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AISTATS*, *CogSci* and serve as a guest editor for *Tsinghua Science and Technology* on a special issue on foundation models in brain science.
